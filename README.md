About the play:

This play was written using the GPT-2 language model released by OpenAI.  To generate the dialogue, I first found a chat generation script called "LEA".  I've modified that extensively and tried a few different approaches.

I've allowed prompts for character names and some context, and then let the computer generate a discussion.  This has produced some interesting results, but requires a lot of after-the-fact pruning or cherrypicking of examples.  The text is computer-generated, but human selected. 

Additinally, to maximize the use of the AI as a creative prompt, I also interacted one-on-one with the AI generator in a chat session.  I decided to call the AI character "Playwright" and ask it questions - such as: What should the names of the characters ?)

Staging notes:

The OpenAI jukebox, released in April 2020, allows for computer generation of a song based on an artist, a genre, and a set of lyrics.  Such a song could be used as intro/outro music for the play.

The setting for the play is a video chat.  Staging options could use a custom background for each actor.  These could be computer-generated images, such as those found on www.artbreeder.com: a fantastic tool for combining images based on their essential qualities (and others).  You can do such things as take a photo of a mosque, combine it with a photo of a church, and then tweak it by adding more jellyfish qualities to it, increasing the jellyfish-ness.  Or the mosquito net-ishness of it.

A few samples are included for consideration on the github page for this project.
