About the play:

This play was written using the GPT-2 language model released by OpenAI.  It was made possible thanks to the work of OpenAI, Huggingface, and many other excellent programmers and researchers.  To generate the dialogue, I first found a chat generation script called "LEA" (with thanks to Lucas Vergeest / "Lucas1988").  I've modified that significantly and tried a few different approaches.   I developed a program that would generate four-character scenes based on a prompt.  I then ran it for several iterations using various prompts, and selected and re-arranged the lines.  I organized it by scene and gave it a basic framework but I wrote none of the dialogue:  even the staging directions within the dialogue are computer generated.  I ran several iterations of the program, combining the same prompt (that I wrote) with a different random number, and then selected the best examples.  

This produced interesting results, but did require a fair amount of after-the-fact pruning/cherrypicking of examples (as much AI-generated art does).  My attempts to have the AI generate a one-act play in one shot did not succeed - although I did get quite a few full scenes or chunks of dialog.  It's fair to say the text of this FT play entry is co-written by human and AI: human-prompted, computer-generated, but human selected.  I discarded many lines, but was able to use a few large chunks.  I also moved other lines around.  I did not however add any lines - my only "human" writing contribution was the prompts that started each cycle of 50-100 generated lines, which I then chose from.  

Additinally, to maximize the use of the AI as a creative prompt, I initially interacted one-on-one with the AI generator in a chat session.  I decided to call the AI character "Playwright" and ask it questions - such as: What should the names of the characters be?  Where should the play be set?  For example, that's how I (we?) decided to give the play its subtitle.  When asked where the play should be set, the program responded: "It takes place in a virtual world, The World of Tomorrow."

Staging notes:

The OpenAI jukebox, released in April 2020, allows for computer generation of a song based on an artist, a genre, and a set of lyrics.  Such a song could be used as intro/outro music for the play.

A suitable staging for the play would be a video chat.  Staging options could use a custom background for each actor.  These could be computer-generated images, such as those found on www.artbreeder.com: a fantastic tool for combining images based on their essential qualities (and others).  One can do such things as take a photo of a mosque, combine it with a photo of a church, and then tweak it by adding more jellyfish qualities to it, increasing the jellyfish-ness.  Or the mosquito net-ishness of it.

A few samples are included for consideration on this page.
